Vehicle Detection and Counting Tool

#Introduction

This project is a Vehicle Detection and Counting Tool that uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers to identify and count vehicles in images or video footage. It can be used for traffic analysis, surveillance, and monitoring vehicle movement.

#Features

Detects and counts vehicles in images and videos

Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier for vehicle detection

Supports real-time and recorded video processing

Customizable detection models

#Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

PIL (Pillow)

Requests (for fetching images from URLs)

#Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6+ recommended). Install the required dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python numpy pillow requests

Usage

#Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the provided .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the cells step by step to see the vehicle detection process.

Modify Image or Video Source:

Update the image/video path in the code to use your own data.

Customize Haar Cascade Model:

Replace the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file with a different model for improved accuracy.

Example Output

Input: Traffic scene image

Output: Image with detected vehicles highlighted and counted

Future Improvements

Implement Deep Learning-based models like YOLO or SSD for better accuracy.

Add support for real-time detection using live camera feeds.
