# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and Counting Tool

## ✨ Introduction
This project is a **Vehicle Detection and Counting Tool** that uses **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade classifiers** to identify and count vehicles in images or video footage. It can be used for traffic analysis, surveillance, and monitoring vehicle movement.

## 🔧 Features
- ✅ Detects and counts vehicles in images and videos
- ✅ Uses OpenCV's **Haar Cascade Classifier** for vehicle detection
- ✅ Supports real-time and recorded video processing
- ✅ Customizable detection models

## 💻 Technologies Used
- ⚡ **Python**
- ⚡ **OpenCV**
- ⚡ **NumPy**
- ⚡ **PIL (Pillow)**
- ⚡ **Requests** (for fetching images from URLs)

## 🛠️ Installation
### 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (✳ Version 3.6+ recommended). Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pillow requests
```

## 💡 Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - 🔍 Open the provided `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - 📚 Run the cells step by step to see the vehicle detection process.

2. **Modify Image or Video Source**:
   - 🎥 Update the image/video path in the code to use your own data.

3. **Customize Haar Cascade Model**:
   - 🔒 Replace the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file with a different model for improved accuracy.

## 📸 Example Output
- 👉 **Input**: Traffic scene image
- 👈 **Output**: Image with detected vehicles highlighted and counted

## 🌐 Future Improvements
- 💡 Implement Deep Learning-based models like **YOLO** or **SSD** for better accuracy.
- 📽️ Add support for real-time detection using live camera feeds.
